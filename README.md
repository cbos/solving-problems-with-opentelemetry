# Insights with OpenTelemetry

This repo contains the demos of my talk 'How I solved production issues with OpenTelemetry (and how you can too)'


## Prerequisites

- Java (can be installed with `sdk install java`)
- [Just commandrunner](https://just.systems/man/en) 
- Docker or [Podman](https://podman.io/


NOTE:
There is a problem with podman and the mount of the opentelemetry jar.
